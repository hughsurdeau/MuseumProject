Main TODO:
    1.5 - Test the new decision making process on a nonlineaar museum layout. Enlarge the museum
    2 - Properly test that the algorithm works with some set scenarios. Really need to be certain its not fucked
    3 - Simulate as a daily thing i.e. one day in the museum over and over. Amount of people entering the museum
        can be variable and thus be something that agents use in their estimation
    4 - Adding time piping ~ do it in 12 hour days, with 144 stages of 10 mins each?



TODO: Maybe interesting approaches
    1 - Maybe a volume level of each room?
