Main TODO:
    3 - Begin introducing dynamics. These include:
        Decision points on how long to stay at each station
        Ability to skip based on subsequent nodes

    Improvements to consider - make the rooms something other than a list. Can instead have a linked list or node with
    the rooms being the secondary thing for cleanliness (i.e. each art piece is a node with its room as an attribute)
